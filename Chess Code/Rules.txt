Issues with online chess
	-No list-building aspect
	-Hard to monetize 


Listbuilding
-Ability of pieces to evolve like Pokemon mid-game
-New pieces for gameplay variety 
-In the future introduce alternative pawn-troop types

Hard to monetize
-New pieces available through loot boxes 
-Battle pass
-Ability to create power creep

Core Gameplay changes
-Nonpawn pieces have a points value, you get 100 points to build your list(You must have a king and a row of pawns)

Knight+bishop=10
Rook = 20
Queen = 30
King(Free and required)


-Players take turns placing their nonpawn pieces

-If one of your pieces lands on a piece of the same type they "evolve" gaining a new special ability



Evolutions
Rook-Mega Rook
-2X2 area
-Enemy pieces it covers while evolving are destroyed
-Allied pieces become embarked, and when the mega rook is destroyed they are dropped off  in an unoccupied part of the 2X2 area


Knight-Mega Knight
-Creates a shockwave on landing destroying all pieces a circle around it

Bishop-Pope
Can move through pawns destroying them

Queen-High Queen
-Can teleport once per round(at the start of either players turn)

Super Pawn
-Can move two every time, and attack backwards diagonally
